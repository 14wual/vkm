# VKM Code of Conduct

## Aim
The goal of this code of conduct is to establish a respectful and welcoming environment for everyone who participates in the VKM project, whether they contribute to the code, report bugs, submit feature requests, or otherwise interact with the community. We expect everyone involved with VKM to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner, and not condone or promote abusive, harassing, or discriminatory behavior.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to everyone who participates in the VKM project, including developers, contributors, end users, and anyone who interacts with the VKM community in any other capacity.

## Expected behavior
We expect everyone involved with VKM to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner. This means:

- Treat all people with respect and consideration, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, ability or any other personal characteristics.

- Not tolerate or promote abusive, harassing or discriminatory behavior at any time.
Use respectful and non-offensive language in all communications, including code, pull requests, bug reports, and online discussions.

- Accept and respect the decisions of the other contributors and core developers, even if you disagree with them.

## Unacceptable behavior

- We will not tolerate or promote abusive, harassing or discriminatory behavior in any way. This includes:

- Comments or actions that denigrate or discriminate against other people because of their gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, ability or any other personal characteristic.

- Harassment, including threats, intimidation, stalking, or any other form of behavior that is intended to annoy, intimidate, or harm another person.

- Comments or actions that promote violence or hatred against any group or individual.

- Comments or actions that are offensive or disrespectful towards anyone involved in VKM.

## What to do if unacceptable behavior occurs

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to VKM Core Developers immediately. You can do so by sending an email to our support team or through any other means of communication that is convenient for you.

All reports of unacceptable behavior will be treated confidentially and will be fully and fairly investigated. If it is determined that unacceptable behavior has occurred, steps will be taken to remedy the situation, including removing the offending behavior and possibly banning the offender from participating in the VKM project in the future.
